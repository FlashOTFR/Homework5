Hello!

What I have for you today is a day planner application!  Utilizing this tool will allow you to keep track of your
schedule and appointments much easier!


I created the front end with basic HTML and CSS, alongside bootstrap for responsiveness.

I used Javascript to create on click functions, these allow the information in the text fields to be put in local storage at the 
press of a button.
I created an init function to make sure that if the page is left and revisted, or refreshed, that the saved information would
be reloaded into the proper fields.

I utilized Moment JS to set up the date display, as well as change the color style of appointments, as they came up, or were passed.
